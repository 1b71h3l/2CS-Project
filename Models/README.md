#### Models tested :
In our project, we conducted extensive experiments using various models (8 different models) for detecting Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). After evaluating their performance based on different metrics, we found that **XGBoost** provided the most accurate results for our specific use case.
In this folder, you can find some of these models ( CNN, LSTM , XGBoost)
