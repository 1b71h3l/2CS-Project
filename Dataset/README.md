#### Our dataset:
We utilized the UTL_DGA22 dataset as the basis for our research. This existing dataset provided a comprehensive collection of domain names, which served as a valuable resource for training and evaluating our botnet detection
model. We obtained the domain names from the text files within the dataset and concatenated them to create our own dataset. The jupyter notebook [`Prepare_dataset.ipynb`](#Prepare_dataset.ipynb) contains the details of this preparation.
