> #### To simulate the malicious activity in our IOT network we did implement a simple application that generates a malicious domain name by using a DGA then sending a DNS query for the 'A' record (IPv4 address) of the  domain , we did the test with these two dga families (banjori,ramdo)
>
> - banjori.py ==> banjori dga family 
> - ramdo.py ==> ramdo dga family
>
>  This code is implemented in the Raspberry Pi boards **botnets** .
You can find Other families on the Internet
